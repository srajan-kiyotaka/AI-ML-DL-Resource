### WHAT IS AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

### WHY CHOOSE AI?

Artificial Intelligence is advancing by leaps and bounds. Recent research in the fields of Data Science, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and other sub fields of AI has already started to impact the lives of common people. AI is no more a superficial concept. It's already used by tech giants, companies and startups to solve everyday problems. That's why choosing AI as a career path is really rewarding in the long run.

Even if your profession is not directly related to tech, still it's said that AI will disrupt every field in one or other ways. That's why you need to have at least a basic understanding of how AI works.

### WHAT IS ML?

Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.

### WHAT IS Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain‚Äîalbeit far from matching its ability‚Äîallowing it to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù from large amounts of data. While a neural network with a single layer can still make approximate predictions, additional hidden layers can help to optimize and refine for accuracy.

Deep learning drives many artificial intelligence (AI) applications and services that improve automation, performing analytical and physical tasks without human intervention. Deep learning technology lies behind everyday products and services (such as digital assistants, voice-enabled TV remotes, and credit card fraud detection) as well as emerging technologies (such as self-driving cars).
